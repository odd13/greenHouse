## About
This is a arduino driven green house. I wanted to do the following basic
functions:
* Test soil moisture and add water if it is not moist enough
* Test humidity and adjust airflow accordingly (open vents and blow fresh air)
* Test Temperature and cool accordingly (open vents and blow fresh air)
